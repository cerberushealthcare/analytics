      Data Security: Defend Against Cyber Thieves
    </h3>
    <p>
      Criminals use manipulative techniques known as <i><b>social engineering</b></i> to deceive their victims into revealing sensitive and personal information. 
      Such scams play on emotions like fear and the human tendency to want to help or trust others.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common approach uses fraudulent <i><b>phishing</b></i> emails, as in fishing for information.  
      The scamming email is often designed to look as though it comes from an individual or organization the recipient will recognize, such as one's bank, charitable organization, the police, IRS, PayPal, or a friend in need. 
      The phony message attempts to fool the recipient into downloading malware on the computer or giving up personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defending against social engineering attacks is difficult because cyber thieves are creative and constantly come up with new approaches, but the following guidance can help avoid becoming a social engineering victim:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        &bull; Think before you click.
      </b>
      Be cautious with any message you don't expect or that doesn't make sense.  
      If you get a message from the Ohio police about a speeding ticket, but you have not been driving in Ohio recently, it's bogus.  
      Delete immediately.  
      Even if you have been driving in Ohio, ask yourself whether it makes sense that the Ohio police have your email address. 
      Probably not.  
      A common approach is to hijack a friends email and send a bogus request that appears to come from someone that you know.   
      Don't click if you aren't sure or if the email seems fishy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        &bull; Be wary of offers of something for nothing.
      </b>
      These are most likely scams.  Won the lottery without entering? Receiving a free gift card from a store that you don't patronize? Likely bogus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        &bull; Check validity with web search.
      </b>
      If you suspect an email is not real or if it doesn't make sense, don't click.  
      Search instead.  
      Many sites list known hoaxes. 
      Reading through these can put your mind at ease.  
      If you receive attachments to emails (especially .zip or .pdf files) that aren't requested or if you aren't 100% sure that they are from who they say they're from.  
      Don't click.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        &bull; Do not respond to unsolicited requests for sensitive information
      </b>  
      whether by email, phone, or text message.
      If an unsolicited caller starts asking for personal information, it's time to end the call.
    </p>

      Clicktate will never send an email requesting a password or any other personal information.    
      We will not request your password in a phone conversation.

    <h3>
      Pay Attention to Your Failed Logins
    </h3>
    <p>
      You may have noticed a login monitor on the Dashboard page.  
      This keeps a running log of all attempts to login into your Clicktate account.  
      Please check this daily.  
      If you notice login attempts into your system that you didn't initiate, please notify Clicktate immediately.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Keep Your Password Secure and Secret
    </h3>
    <p>
      The best way to ensure the integrity of data in your system is to guard all passwords carefully.  
      Clicktate enforces strong passwords, but passwords can be compromised when they are written on a sticky note or otherwise left near a computer.  
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the ways that hackers gain access to systems is to use a <i><b>brute force attack</b></i>, in which the hacker attempts to gain access into a secured system by repeatedly attempting passwords from a dictionary list.   
      While Clicktate has taken steps to significantly lessen the risks of dictionary-based brute force attacks, 
      users can further lessen the risks by using passwords that are at least 8 characters in length, contain numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and special symbols, 
      and that aren't based on words found in the dictionary.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The password <code>Mike</code> will take a brute force attacker seconds to break,
      as will <code>Mike1</code> or 
      <code>Mike!</code>.  
      The password <code>M1ke</code> will take only slightly longer, 
      as hacker algorithms are increasingly programmed to try substitutions such as a "1" for an "i" in these common words.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Disguising a lengthy word with interspersed special symbols and numbers will offer much better protection because it won't be found in the hacker's dictionary.  
      For example, a password based on the word "aquarium" 
      could be  
      <code>Aqu598aR1uM%</code>.
      You could also form a secure password using the first letters of a phrase, substituting capitals, numbers and special symbols for certain letters.
      For example, a password based on the lyric "When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me" could be
      <code>WIfm!t0tMMc2m</code>.
      Both passwords are very secure and would take literally trillions of years to hack with a brute force attack.
