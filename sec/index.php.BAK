                          <p>Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com also have no control over the information that is sent to patients or the method with which that information is sent to patients and therefore Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com take no responsibility for the information that is provided to patients by providers and the method with which that information is shared.  It is recommended that each office and provider utilizing Clicktate.com establish practices to ensure the accuracy and up to date nature of patient preferred contact methods as well as patient demographic data and other patient information and to ensure that this data and the methods of using this data are appropriately utilized.</p>

                          <p>It is the responsibility of each user of Clicktate.com to ensure the accuracy of patient diagnostic information found in Clicktate.com.  Clicktate.com is designed to assist users by automatically populating the patient facesheet with diagnoses placed by providers into signed and locked notes, but Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com make no warranty as to the reliability, accuracy, timeliness, usefulness, adequacy, suitability or completeness for any purpose.  Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com have no way of diagnosing patient conditions, determining or knowing changes in the diagnoses of patients, or tracking the status of patient diagnoses.  All diagnoses are populated to the patient facesheet with a status of â€œActiveâ€?.  It is the responsibility of each provider to develop methods and workflows to determine the accuracy of and ensure that diagnoses and diagnoses statuses are up to date.  </p>
                          <p>Providers should be aware that patients who utilize the patient portal feature of Clicktate.com have access to their diagnosis list, and providers should ensure that patients are aware of the information contained in the diagnosis list. </p>
                          <p>Clicktate.com templates will at times automatically insert a diagnosis into a note and onto a facesheet at the time of the signing and locking of a patient note.  The diagnoses inserted into notes by default are not to be construed as a suggestion for a diagnosis for a patient, nor are the default plans meant to suggest a course of treatment.  Each provider MUST use clinical judgment as they evaluate and manage patients, including diagnosing and treating illnesses.  Clicktate.com DOES NOT replace the knowledge, training and experience of a healthcare professional and MUST NOT be used to replace this knowledge in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.</p>
                          <center><b>Medical Documentation</b></center>
                          <p>The medical documentation section (the â€œConsoleâ€?) of Clicktate.com is designed to allow providers to quickly and accurately document patient encounters.  Predesigned templates may contain items that are not relevant to a particular patient and/or items which were not performed in the course of an office visit.  Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com make no warranty as to the reliability, accuracy, timeliness, usefulness, adequacy, suitability or completeness for any purpose.  Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com have no way to determine what history items, physical exam items and other historical issues were reviewed with a particular patient during a particular visit.  As such, it is important that providers be aware of the contents of the notes found in the Clicktate.com console and utilize Clicktate.com features to delete any historical items, physical exam items, laboratory data, radiologic data, diagnoses, procedures, plans or time elements from pre-populated templates which were not performed in the course of the patient encounter.  Failure to do so may result in inaccuracies of patient medical data as well as billing and coding inaccuracies.</p>

                          <p>Providers should also be aware that patients who utilize the patient portal feature have access to their medication and allergy lists and providers should ensure that patients are aware of the information contained in the medication and allergy lists. In addition, a separate â€œterms of serviceâ€? agreement is provided when providers initially log-in to the electronic prescribing system.  These separate electronic prescribing terms of service are also binding to this agreement.  It is the responsibility of each provider to know the indications for each medication and prescribe medications appropriately.  It is the responsibility of each provider to be knowledgeable regarding the uses, interactions and possible side effects for each medication prescribed.  Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com take no responsibility for any medication prescribed, side effects, interactions or other adverse events associated with the prescribing of medications from within the system.  In addition, no item found within the Clicktate.com system is meant to imply the appropriateness of a medication for a particular purpose, nor is any item found in Clicktate.com meant to suggest a particular medication for any particular purpose.

                          <p>Electronic refill requests generated by pharmacies and sent electronically to the prescriber do not always exactly match the patient demographics found in the Clicktate.com patient record.  Clicktate.com will make an attempt to match the pharmacy refill request to what is considered to be the most appropriate match in the appropriate provider or facility Clicktate.com patient database.  It is the responsibility of anyone refilling a prescription to ensure the accuracy of the patient matched to the refill request, and to select a different patient if the patient found is not the correct patient.

                          <p>The Clicktate.com Clinical Decision Support module also offers a system to suggest past due tests and health maintenance procedures.  This system is dependent upon the accuracy and timeliness of information placed into the Clicktate.com system.  Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com have no way of ensuring the accuracy of information placed into the system.  In addition, Cerberus Healthcare, Inc. and Clicktate.com have no way to monitor the individual patient characteristics that may or may not make a given test appropriate for each patient.  The â€œdue listâ€? found in the clinical decision support module of Clicktate.com should in no way be considered an all encompassing list of every test due for a practice or patient.
